  {
    question: "What is climate change, and what causes it?",
    answer:
      "Climate change refers to long-term changes in global temperatures and weather patterns. While it can occur naturally, the current rapid warming is primarily caused by human activities — especially the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, which release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and trap heat.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does renewable energy help reduce climate change?",
    answer: "Renewable energy like wind and solar produce little to no greenhouse gas emissions, replacing fossil fuels and helping reduce carbon in the atmosphere.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is renewable energy really more affordable than fossil fuels?",
    answer: "Yes, in many regions renewable energy is now cheaper due to falling technology costs and government incentives.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can clean energy sources completely replace fossil fuels?",
    answer: "Yes, over time. With the right investments, infrastructure, and policy support, clean energy can fully power our world sustainably.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the health benefits of switching to renewable energy?",
    answer: "Cleaner air, fewer respiratory and heart diseases, and reduced pollution-related health costs are key benefits of switching.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why should businesses and homeowners invest in solar energy now?",
    answer: "Costs are low, incentives are strong, and long-term savings plus sustainability make solar a smart investment.",
